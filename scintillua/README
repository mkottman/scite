Overview:

  Changes to Scintilla:
    * Replaced all Lex*.cpp files with LexLPeg.cpp and over 56 dynamic Lua
      lexers.
    * Added the following functions:
        * SCI_GETSTYLENAME - returns the string style name at the caret
          position.
    * Existing external lexer modules will not work.
    * No lexer-specific folding (can be added to each lexer).
    * Everything else is identical. 

  Changes to SciTE:
    * Added Lua lpeg.c file.
    * Added the following properties (to be put in SciTEGlobal.properties or
      SciTEUser.properties):
        * lexer.lua.home - directory containing dynamic Lua lexers.
        * lexer.lua.script - path of lexer.lua file.
        * lexer.lua.color.theme - universal color theme to use.
        * fold.by.indentation - fold code by indentation level.
        * decoder.lua.script - path of Lua script to interpret double-clicking
          error messages in the output pane. 
    * Lexer-specific features do not work anymore:
        * Python colon matching.
        * HTML/XML tag auto-completion.
        * Double-clicking on error messages in the output pane (can add a Lua
          script to restore this functionality).
        * Style, keyword, and folding properties in *.properties files. 
    * Everything else is identical. 

  Speed:
    * Single-language dynamic lexers parse the same amount of text as
      Scintilla's original lexers. Any differences in speed should be
      negligible.
    * Multi-language dynamic lexers must parse the entire document and can be
      noticibly slower on large files. 

Compiling:

  Two compile methods:
    * Patch official Scintilla/SciTE with provided `scintillua.patch` and
      compile.
    * Compile provided Scintilla/SciTE.

  Patch:
    1. Download official Scintilla/SciTE and unpack.
    2. Copy `scintillua.patch` to the unpacked directory.
    3. Run 'patch -p1 < scintillua.patch' (without quotes).
    4. Compile as normal.

  Otherwise:
    1. Compile as normal.

  Notes:
    Use scite/boundscheck/SciTE.vcproj for compiling on Windows.
    Use mingw32 on Linux for compiling for Windows (first change '<Shlobj.h>' to
      '<shlobj.h>' in `scite/win32/SciTEWinDlg.cxx`).

Usage:

  Use as you would standard Scintilla/SciTE.

  Note that `SciTE` is the Linux executable and `SciTE.exe` is the Win32 one.

Troubleshooting:

  No or incorrect syntax highlighting:
    1. Make sure your language has a supported lexer (check in the `lexers/`
       directory.
    2. Make sure there is a *.properties file that has your language's
       extension.
       (e.g. file.patterns.rhtml=*.rhtml)
    3. Make sure the file pattern's lexer is correct or exists.
       (e.g. lexer.$(file.patterns.rhtml)=rhtml

    I do not have the time to continuously update *.properties files with
    extensions and lexers, so please be patient if you have to do it manually.
